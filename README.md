# FirstWebsite
This is my first project after 240 hours with a specialist developer.
I combine hard-code with the functionality of the Symfony.

Please follow this steps below after clonig the git.

# Run in terminal:
1. composer install
2. php bin/console server:start
3. php bin/console doctrine:schema:update â€“force
#On the server http://127.0.0.1:8000/
3. You will need to signup. While you are sign-up please fell free to try all the inputs
as i used regular expresion to purify the data that i send in to the database.

#Upcoming features

* the chat will be displayed in all the pages you are by clicking the button 
in the bottom right corner.
* also here i will write a code in javascript to ask for messages from database and reload 
everytime we click the send button, at the moment the messages are not filtered 
and we get the date displayed with the  1970 year.
* for the users i will give them the option to add a friend(other user using the platform)
and also when they are creating a post to choose if to make it private or public
* and if the post
is private it will be displayed just for himself and the friends users.
* on the home page i will display just one Photo from the users but from the public posts.
* the edit about page it will be full of inputs where the user can edit his own profile 
and i also want to give the option to look at an other user profile.
* the contact me i have to work out on this one because i get the e-mail in spam after 1 hour 
 and i dont want that :) . 
 
 Well this been said, Enjoy my project.
